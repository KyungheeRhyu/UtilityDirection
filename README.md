# Utility Flow Direction Assignment

TODO - add details on material (PIPE_TYPE) updates to this section, Overview, and Usage - see Kyunghee's branch 'modifications-2-materials'

This script adds direction information to the attribute table of a line feature class - direction is determined using the starting and ending point. While this can be done for any line feature class, a model of utility networks brought about the need for it.

## Overview

The script **`get_flow_direction.py`** does the following:

1. creates a copy of the input feature class using the specified projected spatial reference
2. adds attribute table fields to hold the following for each line segment:
    - the id's of adjacent segments
    - the bearing of the line segment
    - a cardinal direction of the line segment - one of 'N', 'S', 'E', 'W', 'NW', 'NE', 'SW', 'SE'
3. populates the new fields

## Input Data

The script operates on geospatial data - a feature class of lines stored in an **ArcGIS geodatabase**. The direction of each line segment in the input feature class is represented by the starting point and ending point used to draw each segment.

## Dependencies

The script requires:
- **ArcGIS Pro** with **arcpy**
- **Python 3.x** (as used in ArcGIS)
- **dotenv**

## Usage

1. Ensure all dependencies are installed and that ArcGIS Pro/ArcMap is available with necessary licenses.
2. Configure the .env file according to the file '.env.example' (.env will not be committed to version control)
3. In the run() function of get_flow_direction.py, modify the values assigned to the following variables: spatial_ref_wkid, geographic_transformation, from_adjacent_id, to_adjacent_id, direction_float, direction_text, id_field, and xy_tolerance - see the docstrings and comments for explanations of these
4. Run get_flow_direction.py

The script can be run as a standalone Python script from a terminal (`python path/to/script.py` or `propy path/to/script.py` if using the 'propy' environment provided with ArcGIS Pro).

## Output

After the script is run, the output feature class can be found in the same geodatabase as the input feature class but will have the wkid appended to it e.g. 'input_feature_class_2277'

## Post-Processing

After the script has been run, the following are recommended:

1. Spot-checks of the direction values - check a few locations to ensure that the correct bearing and text direction are found in the respective fields. This can be done using a version of the sanitary sewer lines data styled with direction arrows. Though manual intervention has not been needed for the direction values so far, some of the results should still be checked.
2. Population of the original material field ('PIPE_TYPE' field in the original run of the script) based on the values in the new fields - as of June 6, 2025, this is not done in the script, but the steps below should either be added to the existing script or to a new script. In order to avoid issues with modifying an existing domain, it may be necessary to export the feature class produced by the script to a separate (new) geodatabase before attempting to edit the original material field. Note: all SQL statements below (e.g. steps 1 and 3 below) are for use in the SQL option of 'Select by Attributes' in ArcGIS Pro

The steps below involve the material fields. The two sets of 16 steps could be combined into a single set of 16 by wrapping each SQL statements in parentheses and connecting them with 'OR'. In each set of 16 steps below, the first two steps must be done first - the order of the remaining steps does not matter (and note that the order of steps 3-16 is different between the two sets below).

For cases where the original material field (PIPE_TYPE) should be updated and the From_Material and To_Material values match:
1. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND From_Material = To_Material` 
2. Using 'Calculate Field', set Material_Source equal to ‘Adjacency’ for the selected records
3. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'Unknown'` 
4. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 0
5. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'Ductile Iron'`
6. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 4
7. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'Cast Iron'`
8. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 3
9. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'PVC'` 
10. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 1
11. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'RCP'`
12. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 2
13. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'VCP'` 
14. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 5
15. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND (From_Material = To_Material) AND From_Material = 'R.C.C.P'`
16. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 6

For cases where the original material field (PIPE_TYPE) should be updated where either From_Material or To_Material is not null and the other (From_Material or To_Material) is null (visually, resembles a dead-end situation but flow is away from a starting point) - in other words, a segment with unknown material is adjacent only to a single segment with known material:
1. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null))`
2. Using 'Calculate Field', set Material_Source equal to ‘Adjacency’ for the selected records
3. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'R.C.C.P' OR To_Material = 'R.C.C.P')`
4. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 6
5. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'VCP' OR To_Material = 'VCP')` 
6. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 5
7. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'RCP' OR To_Material = 'RCP')`
8. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 2
9. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'PVC' OR To_Material = 'PVC')` 
10. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 1
11. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'Cast Iron' OR To_Material = 'Cast Iron')` 
12. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 3
13. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'Ductile Iron' OR To_Material = 'Ductile Iron')`
14. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 4
15. `(PIPE_TYPE IS NULL Or PIPE_TYPE = 0) AND ((From_Material IS NULL AND To_Material IS NOT null) OR (To_Material IS NULL AND From_Material IS NOT null)) AND (From_Material = 'Unknown' OR To_Material = 'Unknown')`
16. Using 'Calculate Field', set PIPE_TYPE equal to 0

Following these steps, the portion of the script that modifies the material fields should be re-run, but the input feature class fed to the script will be the feature class modified in the two sets of 16 steps above.

The output feature class of that second run of the script that modifies the material fields will then be modified using the sets of 16 steps above. 

This process can be repeated a few times (which is why the 16 steps of SQL/Calculate-Field operations should be scripted). Each time the process is run, however, the output feature class should be spot-checked for accuracy.
